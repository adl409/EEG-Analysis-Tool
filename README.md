# Senior-Project-
This repository will contain all of the models in separate branches and all of the test results as we progress with it.

## Scope
This project is used to test if machine learning can have a better impact on EEG and predictions. In this project we are given a large dataset from an experiment performed by our researcher.  The experiment that was performed was as follows, given the choice of clicking a button on the left or a button on the right, which will the user press and how fast and accurate will a machine learning model be able to determine the choice of the user. In the dataset, we are given the choices of each user and the data is split into the amount of time that was taken to decide to press the button.  We will be using this data as testing and training for the model to see if it is able to predict the user's decision within a 90% accuracy rate within 500 milliseconds.

## Goals
The goal of this project is to get the most accurate prediction of our research which is how well can machine learning predict a user's decision given two choices.
